# Lab 1 for Parallel Processing.

This lab consists of two seperate java projects. One is a server, the other is a client. The server allows the client to play a game of hangman where the player has to guess the name of a movie. The server can manage the game for multiple clients. To set up the game, you have to run the server then start the client. After you start the server it will give you the port number. To start the client you pass the port as an argument. Example of starting the client "java -jar SkeletonClient.jar 'localhost' '52411'". You would need to build the client into a jar file first.
